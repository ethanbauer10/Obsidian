# Objective and scope

**ShadowGate** recently completed a corporate acquisition that significantly expanded its internal network, user base, and application footprint. Several business-critical systems were migrated and consolidated under tight operational deadlines to minimize downtime and maintain service continuity.

While functional validation was completed, the organization deferred a comprehensive security assessment due to delivery pressure and staffing constraints. Leadership has since requested an independent penetration test to validate the security posture of the newly created environment and identify any material risk before the next audit cycle.

The assessment will evaluate whether a motivated attacker with standard network access could compromise sensitive systems, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the enterprise environment.

The Hack Smarter team has been authorized to perform a black box internal penetration test against the ShadowGate environment.
