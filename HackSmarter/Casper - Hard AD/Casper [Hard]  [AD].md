# Objective and scope
You have been engaged to conduct an internal penetration test targeting a domain-joined Linux server and its underlying Domain Controller. The client wants to evaluate the true impact and potential blast radius if an unauthenticated attacker breaches the internal network.

The client has provided you with VPN access to their environment, but no other information.
